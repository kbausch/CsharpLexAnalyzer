The demonstration code reads uses the OpenFileDialog class to get the name of a file containing SchemeExpress source code, or a csv file for the lexical analyzer and token table. The assignment allows the location of the lexical analyzer and token tables to be hard coded. For extra credit, allow two options - hard coded  locations and the ability to select the files.
